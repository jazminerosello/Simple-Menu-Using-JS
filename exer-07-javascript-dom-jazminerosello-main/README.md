TOPIC: JS DOM

This exercises is all about adding cards and being able to delete a card when delete button in the card is click.
A card will only be added if the users input in the form are complete, meaning they did not miss any fields to fill out. 
In a card, all the information, users input for the foods will be there and there will be button delete, if users click the delete button
the card will be removed.
Also, the challenge here is actually sorting the cards based on the rank number, to be able to achieve this specification, I used an array wherein I store there the value of rank then I sort the array. Array is my basis whether the new card will be inserted at the last or in between. In terms of inserting the new card in between of 2 cards that are already in the web server, I used the 'insertbefore' and if last then I used appendChild.
To be able to append a child to the middle part, I initialized an element using createElement that will be the children of the div then I also initialized and declared all the textnode in those elements I created and then I append those to the div, then append div as a child to the middle.
